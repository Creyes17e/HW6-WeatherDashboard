## Description

The weather dashboard will help the user find city current weather and a 5day forecast. The Dashboard displays City Name, Date, Weather Icon, Temperature in Farenheit, Humidity, Wind Speed, & UV Index (with conditions being color coded). After refreshing the page the dashboard will display the last searched city weather information along with the city button.

## Installation

Created a repo in github with a README.md. Through gitbash I cloned the repo I pulled and pushed the origin master to add pages and folders in github. I added and committed meaningful changes and updated the html, css, and js code.
